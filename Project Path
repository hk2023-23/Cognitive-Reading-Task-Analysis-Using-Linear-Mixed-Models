# 🧠 Cognitive Reading Task Analysis Using Linear Mixed Models

This project investigates how gender, cue condition, and word color influence reading speed using linear mixed-effects modeling (LMM). The analysis is based on data from 36 subjects who completed four randomized reading tasks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Model repeated measures data using LMM
- Estimate fixed and random effects
- Test hypotheses about group differences in reading time
- Predict subject-specific performance
- Evaluate model structure using variance-covariance matrices

## 📊 Dataset

- **File**: `Cognitive.csv`
- **Subjects**: 36
- **Variables**:
  - `T`: Reading time
  - `G`: Gender
  - `C`: Cue condition (Congruent/Incongruent)
  - `W`: Word color (Red/Green)
  - `S`: Subject ID

## 🧪 Methods

- Linear mixed-effects model using `lmer()` from the `lme4` package
- Fixed effects: Gender, Cue, Word Color, and their interactions
- Random effects: Subject-specific intercepts and slopes
- Hypothesis testing using `glht()` from `multcomp`
- Residual and random effect analysis
- Variance-covariance matrix extraction
